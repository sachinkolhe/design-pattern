### Adapter Design Pattern

The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, enabling collaboration and reuse of existing code.

### Key Concepts

1. **Target Interface**: This is the interface that the client code expects to interact with. The client is designed to work with this interface.

2. **Adaptee**: This is the existing interface or class that needs to be adapted to the target interface. It may have methods that the client wants to use, but its interface is incompatible.

3. **Adapter**: This is the class that implements the target interface and translates calls to the adapteeâ€™s interface. The adapter acts as a middleman, converting the interface of the adaptee into a format that the client can use.

### When to Use

- When you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need.
- When you want to create a reusable class that can work with various interfaces.
- When you want to provide a consistent interface to a set of classes with varying interfaces.


### Benefits

- **Flexibility**: You can integrate new classes without modifying existing code.
- **Reusability**: You can reuse existing classes and interfaces, promoting cleaner code.
- **Separation of Concerns**: It separates the interface from its implementation, making the code easier to maintain.

The Adapter Design Pattern is widely used in Java, especially in libraries and frameworks that need to integrate with various systems or provide a consistent API.
